# Dark-Light
## Companion for visually impaired and blind people.

### Description
**Dark Light** guides the visually impaired during their mobility. Advancements in embedded systems have opened up a vast area of research and development for affordable and portable assistive devices for the visually challenged. This system aims to design and implement a detachable unit that acts to augment the functionality of the existing cane to allow knee-above obstacle detection. The objective of developing 'Dark Light' is for the visually impaired/blind to get connected or feel the real-time environment. This device contains an Ultrasonic sensor connected with Arduino. It transmits the information to the people using earphones to convey the distance measured for the obstacle present in front of them. A visually challenged person can rely/depend on this technological device. The device can measure a block up to a distance of 2m.
